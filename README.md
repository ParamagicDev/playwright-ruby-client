# ðŸŽ­ Playwright client for Ruby

Note: Currently, this Gem is just a PoC (Proof of Concept). If you want to develop browser-automation for Chrome with Ruby, consider using [puppeteer-ruby](https://github.com/YusukeIwaki/puppeteer-ruby). The list of the available APIs of playwright-ruby-client is [here](./docs/api_coverage.md)

## Getting Started

At this point, playwright-ruby-client doesn't include the downloader of playwright driver, so **we have to install [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) in advance**.

```sh
npm install playwright
./node_modules/.bin/playwright install
```

and then, set `playwright_cli_executable_path: ./node_modules/.bin/playwright` at `Playwright.create`.

**Prefer playwrighting without Node.js?**

Instead of npm install, you can also directly download playwright driver from playwright.azureedge.net/builds/. The URL can be easily detected from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/blob/79f6ce0a6a69c480573372706df84af5ef99c4a4/setup.py#L56-L61)

### Capture a site

```ruby
require 'playwright'

Playwright.create(playwright_cli_executable_path: '/path/to/playwright') do |playwright|
  playwright.chromium.launch(headless: false) do |browser|
    page = browser.new_page
    page.goto('https://github.com/YusukeIwaki')
    page.screenshot(path: './YusukeIwaki.png')
  end
end
```

### Simple scraping

```ruby
require 'playwright'

Playwright.create(playwright_cli_executable_path: './node_modules/.bin/playwright') do |playwright|
  playwright.chromium.launch(headless: false) do |browser|
    page = browser.new_page
    page.goto('https://github.com/')

    form = page.query_selector("form.js-site-search-form")
    search_input = form.query_selector("input.header-search-input")
    search_input.click
    page.keyboard.type("playwright")
    page.expect_navigation {
      page.keyboard.press("Enter")
    }

    list = page.query_selector("ul.repo-list")
    items = list.query_selector_all("div.f4")
    items.each do |item|
      title = item.eval_on_selector("a", "a => a.innerText")
      puts("==> #{title}")
    end
  end
end
```

```sh
$ bundle exec ruby main.rb
==> microsoft/playwright
==> microsoft/playwright-python
==> microsoft/playwright-cli
==> checkly/headless-recorder
==> microsoft/playwright-sharp
==> playwright-community/jest-playwright
==> microsoft/playwright-test
==> mxschmitt/playwright-go
==> microsoft/playwright-java
==> MarketSquare/robotframework-browser
```

### Android browser automation

```ruby
require 'playwright'

Playwright.create(playwright_cli_executable_path: './node_modules/.bin/playwright') do |playwright|
  devices = playwright.android.devices
  unless devices.empty?
    device = devices.last
    begin
      puts "Model: #{device.model}"
      puts "Serial: #{device.serial}"
      puts device.shell('ls /system')

      device.launch_browser do |context|
        page = context.pages.first
        page.goto('https://github.com/YusukeIwaki')
        page.click('header button')
        page.click('input[name="q"]')
        page.keyboard.type('puppeteer')
        page.expect_navigation {
          page.keyboard.press('Enter')
        }
        page.screenshot(path: 'YusukeIwaki.android.png')
      end
    ensure
      device.close
    end
  end
end
```

### Android native automation

We have to download android-driver for Playwright in advance.

```
wget https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/raw/master/bin/android-driver-target.apk -O /path/to/playwright-driver/package/bin/android-driver-target.apk
wget https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/raw/master/bin/android-driver.apk -O /path/to/playwright-driver/package/bin/android-driver.apk
```

(If you downloaded Playwright via npm, replace `/path/to/playwright-driver/package/` with `./node_modules/playwright/` above.)

```ruby
require 'playwright'

Playwright.create(playwright_cli_executable_path: ENV['PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_EXECUTABLE_PATH']) do |playwright|
  devices = playwright.android.devices
  unless devices.empty?
    device = devices.last
    begin
      device.shell('input keyevent POWER')
      device.shell('input keyevent POWER')
      device.shell('input keyevent 82')
      sleep 1
      device.shell('cmd statusbar expand-notifications')

      # pp device.tree
      # pp device.info(res: 'com.android.systemui:id/clock')
      device.tap_on(res: 'com.android.systemui:id/clock')
    ensure
      device.close
    end
  end
end

```
