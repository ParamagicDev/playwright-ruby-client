# playwright-ruby-client

A Ruby client for Playwright driver.

## Getting Started

At this point, playwright-ruby-client doesn't include the downloader of playwright-cli, so **we have to install [playwright-cli](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) in advance**.

```sh
npm install playwright-cli
./node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli install
```

and then, set `playwright_cli_executable_path: ./node_modules/.bin/playwright-cli` at `Playwright.create`.

Instead of npm install, you can also directly download playwright-cli from playwright.azureedge.net/builds/. The URL can be detected from [here](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/blob/79f6ce0a6a69c480573372706df84af5ef99c4a4/setup.py#L56-L61)

### Capture a site

```ruby
require 'playwright'

Playwright.create(playwright_cli_executable_path: '/path/to/playwright-cli') do |playwright|
  playwright.chromium.launch(headless: false) do |browser|
    page = browser.new_page
    page.goto('https://github.com/YusukeIwaki')
    page.screenshot(path: './YusukeIwaki.png')
  end
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
