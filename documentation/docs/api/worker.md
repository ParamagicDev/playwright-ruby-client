# Worker

The Worker class represents a [WebWorker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API). `worker`
event is emitted on the page object to signal a worker creation. `close` event is emitted on the worker object when the
worker is gone.

def handle_worker(worker):
    print("worker created: " + worker.url)
    worker.on("close", lambda: print("worker destroyed: " + worker.url))

page.on('worker', handle_worker)

print("current workers:")
for worker in page.workers:
    print("    " + worker.url)
